# Alpha Handoff Log

Purpose: capture every handoff state with timestamp, owner transition, status, and the single prescribed next step.

## Handoff Entries

| Timestamp (PST) | From | To | State | Notes | Prescribed Next Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-24 22:05 | Project Setup | Sprint Team | Initialized | Created persona guide, PRD placeholder, memory baseline, and handoff log. | Populate PRD.md for Round 1 with goals, scope, constraints, and acceptance criteria. |
| 2026-02-24 22:15 | Sprint Team | Build Team | PRD Refined | Performed a quality pass on PRD.md: tightened structure, clarified requirements, added success criteria, NFRs, security rules, and testable acceptance criteria. | Convert PRD.md into Round 1 implementation backlog (epics, stories, and task breakdown). |
| 2026-02-24 22:17 | Product Direction | Sprint Team | Governance Updated | Added mandatory per-round discipline voice logging (objections/advice/guidance/admonishment/frustration) in TEAM_VOICES.md, with blocker escalation to handoff flow. | Start Round 1 backlog with corresponding Round 1 TEAM_VOICES.md section opened before implementation. |
| 2026-02-24 22:19 | Product Manager (Jon) | Build Team | Operating Directive Received | PM/Creative Director directive captured: execute independently, but escalate for support before likely failure. Logged in TEAM_VOICES.md and MEMORY.md. | Produce Round 1 implementation backlog with explicit risk checkpoints + escalation triggers. |

## Usage Rules
- Add one row per handoff event (no silent transitions).
- Keep “Prescribed Next Step” singular, concrete, and testable.
- If blocked, state blocker and owner explicitly in Notes.
- Any blocker raised in `TEAM_VOICES.md` must be referenced here before progressing.
- Never overwrite history; append only.
